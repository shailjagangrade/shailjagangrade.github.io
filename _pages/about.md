Land-Sea Connections: Investigating Ecosystem Transitions Across Shore
======
Shailja's research employs oceanographic observations to investigate planktonic ecosystem dynamics from coastal waters to the offshore open ocean. Shailja's teaching also centers around marine ecosystem dynamics, in particular the exploration of how ecosystems are shaped by environmental conditions and gradients -- as well as human impacts.

Coastal upwelling dynamics & phytoplankton communities
------
Wind-driven coastal upwelling is spatially and temporally dynamic. Upwelling-favorable winds drives "pulses" of nutrient-rich water into the sunlit water column. This process results in the development of phytoplankton patches at the coast that are rapidly transported offshore. Identifying the location and composition of these patches is important in diagnoising potential ecological hotspots and feeding grounds for zooplankton, fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals.

(Sub)mesoscale ocean stirring & plankton succession
------
Swirling ocean currents are able to tranport passively drifting plankton hundreds of kilometers within several days. Therefore, as entire planktonic ecosystems are transported, they also undergo ecological succession: communities shift from large to small phytoplankton, and zooplankton such as copepods proliferate after feeding on certain phytoplankton. Stationary measurements by ships or sensor platforms often only capture a "patch" of plankton passing by, but particle-tracking techniques allow us to reconstruct the histories of water parcels to evaluate how ecosystems change along these trajectories.

Ecological impacts of extreme terrestrial precipitation 
------
Extreme precipitation events on land can result in high amounts of freshwater discharge into the ocean, with important implications for nutrient and carbon cycling. By using a combination of physical and biogeochemical measurements, we can evaluate how freshwater communities might be distinct from surrounding ocean waters, and we can characterize the rapid transport of such waters into the offshore oligotrophic (low-nutrient) region.

How the ocean feeds us
------
How do regional ocean dynamics play a role in sustaining robust commercial and subsistence fisheries? In regions such as Alaska, changing land and ocean conditions have detrimentally impacted critical food sources for local and native communities. Shailja's teaching incorporates an experiential study of the ecological underpinnings of "healthy" populations of food sources, such as salmon. To learn more, visit the "Teaching" page.
